# gogenesis
Container-deployable test data generation API written in Go

The aim of this project is to;
1. Take the existing Genesis functionality and enhance it
2. Add an API to accept the data configuration (in addition to the CLI???)
3. Containerise it

To do this, I will need to learn (at the least);
1. Writing code in Go
2. Writing an API
2. How to containerise the code
